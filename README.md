# Download Garmin Connect Data

[![Travis CI Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-link]

This software downloads TCX files and accompanying activity metadata files from
the Garmin Connect website.  Since Garmin has discontinued its API to download
your data this software was written to take its place.  It is the opinion of
the author that this data generated by the athlete should be accessible via an
automated method and not constrained to a Web GUI interface.

Features:
* Download Garmin activity data.
* Track data in an [SQLite] database (avoid re-downloading).
* Sync duration statistics with GoogleSheets.
* Print basic information and statistics on previous activities.
* Convenient importing in your favorite analysis tool (i.e. [GoldenCheetah]).

## Obtaining

The easist way to install the command line program is via the `pip` installer:
```bash
pip install zensols.garmdown
```

Binaries are also available on [pypi].


## Data Life Cycle

1. Download activities.  These are independent blocks of data that provide
   information used to later download the respective TCX file.
2. Download the TCX file.  The TCX file has all the information needed by
   workout analysis applications like [GoldenCheetah].
3. Import TCX file.  This step simply copies downloaded files to a directory
   that's easy to access by the workout analysis application.
4. Ingest TCX files.  Import all files in the import folder to your data
   workout analysis application.  After this step you delete the folder as
   subsequent invocations of step 3 will regenerate it.
5. Backup the activities database.  In the rare case the binary database file
   (see below) might be corrupted, a backup is made every `N` days (where `N`
   is specified in a configuration file).

All state between all of these steps are recorded in an SQLite database, which
is a binary file stored on the file system.  If this doesn't make sense to you,
it means that you shouldn't need to install anything special and it *lives* on
your disk.


# History

This is inspired by [Shannon's original project], which was used to navigate
the convoluted Garmin client API.


## Usage

The easiest way to use the program is to use the `sync` action repeatedly
until the program doesn't do anything, example:
```bash
$ garmdown sync
```

This invokes all [data life cycle steps](#data-life-cycle), meaning it imports
activities in to the database, downloads the TCX files and creates a handy
import directory (by default in your desktop directory `~/Desktop/to-import`).
